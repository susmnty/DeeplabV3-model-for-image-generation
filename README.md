# Simple Image Segmentation using DeepLabV3

This project performs image segmentation using the DeepLabV3 model from PyTorch's `torchvision` library. It allows users to input an image and get a segmented output based on pre-trained COCO weights.

## ðŸ”§ Features
- Uses DeepLabV3 with ResNet backbone
- Supports PNG/JPG image input
- Runs on CPU or GPU
- Outputs segmented masks

## ðŸš€ How to Run
```bash
python "DeepLabV3 model for image segmentation.py"
```
